// Functional programming is all about separation of concerns, packaging our code into separate chunks
// Pure functions, the idea here is that there's a separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program
// Objects created in functional programming are immutable
// The goal of functional programming is not make everything pure functions
// The goal is to minimize side effects
// The idea is to organize your code, whether there is a specific part that has side effects

// Avoiding side effects and writing pure functions would be called functional programming
// Code is essentially a combination of functions, and data is immutable which leads to write programs with no side effects and pure functions
// Performing many different operations for which the data is fixed
// stateless
// pure
// declarative

// Functional programming says that data and behavior are distinctly different things and should be kept separate for clarity.
