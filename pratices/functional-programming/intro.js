// Functional programming is all about separation of concerns, packaging our code into separate chunks
// Pure functions, the idea here is that there's a separation between data of a program and the behavior of a program
// Objects created in functional programming are immutable
// The goal of functional programming is not make everything pure functions
// The goal is to minimize side effects
// The idea is to organize your code, whether there is a specific part that has side effects
