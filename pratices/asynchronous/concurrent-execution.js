// Web Worker
// A javaScript process that runs in the background of a webpage.
// Separate javaScript thread that allows you to execute multiple thread of javascript in parallel with each other.

// javaScript by default is a single threaded, one thread or execution path (main thread) responsible for executing all the javascript for a webpage one line at a time.
// Web worker can be created to offload any computationally expensive work so the main thread doesn't get bogged down and can continue executing some other code.

// Web worker cannot perform any DOM manipulation only the main thread can access and manipulate the DOM.

// Concurrency (Single-Core CPU)
// Is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time by managing the execution of these tasks.
// The idea is about dealing with lots of things at once.
// Alternating between tasks.

// Parallelism (Multi-Core CPU)
// Involves the simultaneous of multiple tasks which actually run at the same time or multiple processors or cores.
// Two Computational things are happening at the same time.
