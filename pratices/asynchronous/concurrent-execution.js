// Web Worker
// A JavaScript program running in a separate thread, parallel to the main thread, allowing background tasks without blocking the UI.

// Concurrency (Single-Core CPU)
// Single-threaded execution where tasks are interleaved but only one runs at a time, with the browser or Node handling background work.

// Concurrency + Parallelism (Multi-Core CPU)
// Multi-core CPUs allow multiple threads to run simultaneously in parallel, each on a separate core.
