// Organizing the code into unites would be called object oriented programming

// Encapsulation
// Group related code into classes to restrict access to internal details, making components easier to manage and reuse.

//Abstraction
// Simplify interfaces by hiding complex logic, exposing only necessary methods and properties to the user.

// Inheritance
// Reuse code across components by inheriting common functionality from parent classes, reducing duplication.

// Polymorphism
// Enable different objects to respond uniquely to the same method call, allowing flexible and extensible design.

/*
    Created Code
    Clear and understandable
    easy to extend
    easy to maintain
*/

// memory efficient (objects use references instead of cloning and copying)
// Code dry (one place were creating functionality)

// The pieces of information inside of the object are called attributes or state, and the operations that can happen on this state are known as methods

// OOP says bring both data and behavior in a single location called object or class
// This is going to allow us to understand our program easier and be more organized
