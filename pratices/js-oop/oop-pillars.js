// Encapsulation
// wrap code into boxes that are related to one another
// so that these boxes can just interact with each other using the methods and properties that we make available
// this makes code easier to maintain and more reusable
// we have all these nice little class packages that we can just use it when ever we want

// Abstraction
// hiding the complexity from the user that is creating simpler interfaces
// the idea is here are the methods and properties that you can use.
// don't worry about everything else. I'll do all the calculations behind the scenes.
// this reduces complexity because we can just see the methods and understand what this class can do
// the idea also helps when we have private variables and private methods, something that JavaScript is working towards

// Inheritance
// Inheriting from other classes, we avoid having to write the same code
// we also save memory space by having shared methods

// polymorphism
// the idea is the ability to call the same method on different objects and each object responding in different way.
// the idea of ability to appear in many forms, that is, we're simply doing method overwriting
// it has ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class
// redefine methods for derived classes and allowing us to re-use some of the functionality but also customize methods to their own objects and classes
// we can re-use some of the functionality from a superclass to adapt to our own needs.

/*
    Created Code
    Clear and understandable
    easy to extend
    easy to maintain
*/

// memory efficient (objects use references instead of cloning and copying)
// Code dry (one place were creating functionality)
