What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a collection of values organized in a specific way to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

What is an Algorithm?
Algorithms are the steps or processes used to manipulate the values in a data structure.

Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms
These are fundamental, timeless concepts that apply across programming languages and environments (whether in frontend, backend, game development, etc.).
Mastering them allows you to adapt to changing technologies and tackle a wide range of technical problems.

Value in the Industry
Companies like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google prioritize questions on data structures and algorithms during interviews because they reveal a developer's problem-solving capabilities, beyond just knowing trendy libraries or syntax.

Long-term Relevance
Understanding these concepts is critical for long-term success as a developer or engineer, helping you write better code and solve complex issues efficiently.

Foundation of Great Programs
Knowledge of data structures and algorithms enables you to build robust programs, optimize performance, and make sound decisions.

Takeaway:
Focusing on learning data structures and algorithms is essential for becoming a versatile, effective developer. They will enable you to excel in coding interviews and tackle real-world challenges confidently.

What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a collection of values that can have relationships and can have functions applied to them.
Each data structure is specialized for certain tasks and scenarios, making it efficient for specific types of operations.

Every Data Structure Has a Purpose:
Data structures are like containers in real life (e.g., backpacks, drawers, fridges) that are designed for storing specific things.
Using the wrong data structure for a task can lead to inefficiencies, just like putting yogurt in a drawer will spoil it.

Common Data Structures:
While there are many data structures, most programming problems can be solved with a few key ones (like arrays, objects, and others).
Data structures like blockchain are also just specific ways of storing and organizing data.

Real-Life Analogy:
In life, humans organize and store things to create order out of chaos. Similarly, in programming, we use data structures to organize data to make it accessible and manageable.

Trade-offs in Data Structures:
Just like code has trade-offs in readability, memory, and speed, so do data structures. Each is better in certain situations and worse in others.
Understanding the trade-offs helps in choosing the right data structure for the task at hand.

Two Parts to Mastering Data Structures:
Building data structures: Learning how to create data structures using code.
Using data structures: The most important part, understanding how and when to use pre-built data structures effectively.

Goal:
The goal is to learn how to choose the right data structure based on the problem you are solving, optimizing for efficiency and performance based on the scenario.

Takeaway:
Data structures are essential tools in programming that help you organize and manage data efficiently. The key to becoming a better developer is understanding how to use the right data structure for the right problem, and knowing the trade-offs involved.

How computers store data?

RAM vs. Storage:
RAM (Random Access Memory): Temporary, fast memory used by programs while running. Data is lost when the computer shuts down.
Persistent Storage: Permanent, slower storage (e.g., hard drives, SSDs) where files and programs are saved for long-term use.

CPU and Memory Access:
CPU (Central Processing Unit): Executes tasks and processes data. It interacts with both RAM (faster) and storage (slower).
Memory Controller: Connects the CPU to RAM, enabling quick access to any memory address (random access).
Locality of Reference: Programs access memory addresses that are close together for faster performance.

RAM Structure:
RAM is divided into shelves (addresses), each holding 1 byte (8 bits).
Bits: Represented as 1s and 0s, they store data in RAM. More bits mean larger data storage capacity.
Addressing: The CPU can jump to any specific memory address instantly, allowing for fast data retrieval.

Cache:
CPU Cache: A small, fast memory that stores recently accessed data for quick access. It improves speed when accessing frequently used information.
LRU Cache: (Least Recently Used) cache is a data structure that removes the least recently accessed items first to efficiently manage limited storage.

Data Structures:
Arrangement of Data: Data structures determine how data is stored in RAM (either consecutively or spread apart).
Efficiency: The organization of data structures affects how quickly the CPU can read and write information, influencing program performance.

32-bit vs. 64-bit Systems:
Bit Systems: Define how much data can be processed or stored. Higher-bit systems (64-bit) allow for storing and processing larger amounts of data compared to lower-bit systems (e.g., 8-bit or 32-bit).

Integer Overflow:
Systems have limits on how large numbers can be stored. When a number exceeds the limit, it results in overflow (e.g., infinity in JavaScript).

Key Takeaways:
RAM is fast but temporary, storage is slow but permanent.
Efficient memory access is crucial for performance (locality of reference, caching).
Choosing the right data structure is important for optimizing how data is stored and accessed by the CPU.

Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Tries
- Graph
- Hash Tables

Algorithms:
- Sorting
- Dynamic programming
- BFS (Breadth First Search) + DFS (Depth First Search) (Searching)
- Recursion

Most languages have enough data structures and data types focus to build and create our own data structure.

Operations on Data Structure:
- Insertion: Add a new data item in a given collection of items.
- Deletion: Deleted data.
- Traversal: Access each data item exactly once so that it can be processed.
- Searching: Find out the location of thr data item if it exists in a given collections.
- Sorting: Having data that is sorted.
- Access: How do we access this data that we have on our computer.
